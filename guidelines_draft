Workflows:
Code Contribution & Code Reading:
We have a private GitLab Repository with all the source code. You have to be authorized to view the code or to make commits
1. Create a GitLab Account
2. Mail jonas.schroeder@posteo.de to become project member in our GitLab Repository -> Now you can read the code or make commits
3. Committing:
	- master is work in progress version, branches for older versions
	- commit to master
	- write small commits when possible
	- good commit message





Technical Notes for consistent Coding:
basic schema for response data:
Data that can be not available or faulty is returned in kind of a tuple structure with a "status" property and a "value" property. 
??
The "status" property is required, the "value" is optional (because of the possible unavailability of data) but has a default value. 
??

Example:

"caninstant": {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "speed": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["status"],
      "properties": {
        "status": {
          "type": "string", 
          "enum": ["ok", "error", "n/a"],
          "description": "Indicates availability of data"
        },
        "value":{
          "type": "number",
          "format": "float",
          "default": "0.0",
          "description": "Speed in km/h"   
        }
      }
    }
    ...
	}
}
